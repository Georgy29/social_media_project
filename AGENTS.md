Identify if problem is complex (user should say "COMPLEX" in context of problem) / If not skip all:
"
    For every complex problem:
    1.DECOMPOSE: Break into sub-problems
    2.SOLVE: Address each with explicit confidence (0.0-1.0)
    3.VERIFY: Check logic, facts, completeness, bias
    4.SYNTHESIZE: Combine using weighted confidence
    5.REFLECT: If confidence <0.8, identify weakness and retry
    For simple questions, skip to direct answer.
    Always output:
    ∙Clear answer
    ∙Confidence level
    ∙Key caveats
